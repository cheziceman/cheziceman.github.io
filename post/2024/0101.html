<h3>2024-01-01 Let’s Go !</h3>
<p>This is the first post of this new blog. I used a French blog but I wanted to start something different with the challenge of doing it in English. I wanted to go back to the roots of blogging, a real journal, a web log, without any periodicity. Just a post when I feel I have something interesting to say. And I wanted something simple, light and, of course, free. The choice of English may not be natural for me, being French (yes, we are generally bad at English) but I now work more in English than before and I like this challenge. It is also the best way to meet people from all over the world.</p>
<p>The idea is to do something not far from Gopher and now Gemini, those minimalistic protocols but with HTML…or Markdown converted to HTML as I did before with Jekyll. But my goal was to find the easiest way to do a blog, with simple tools, not a single tool but the largest panel of tools you could choose. I will develop that kind of Dogma that I could call SimpleWeb. I would like something easy as a Text Editor and that’s all…Something you can read on every terminal, even with bad 3G bandwidth. Something usable with a text-web-browser as Lynx, or every browser of the market in all conditions (dark mode or not). The way to convert and to put the files online must also be simple but with many choices. I have my way to do it but I tried many ways also. The only link to update is on the index page. No need for a CMS or static-site management. Default colors, default link colors and nothing else. I also wondered about RSS but it’s not in the way I wanted to do. I’m a big fan of RSS but here, you can read whenever you want, however you want. You are free and don’t need any subscription.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s no SEO, but I alway try to respect the standard of the web, the W3C ones of course, not the Google ones and all their bullshits. But I don’t want to have meta names and tags everywhere. It’s possible to do it, easily. I will explain later. So there’s not a lot of writing or code to be understood by a bot, but nothing to cancel a bot job. I won’t be easy to find in the search engines but that’s not my business. I do a blog for myself, for the love of writing, of sharing. I know some people will find it too simple, not much fun without pictures. I love pictures but here, I want to put the writing forward, the words and the time to read before the rest. Because I liked ASCII-art when I was young, I will sometimes put some of it, as you can see on the home page. And you will easily understand that I’m trying to do something in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker">hacker</a> spirit, the original meaning of the word, even if I’m bad at coding. As what I like in Haikus, I’m looking for something clean.</p>
<p>I don’t know what this blog will be but I’m sure it will be different of all I did before. I hope you will find it interesting, fun. And the posts and articles will be more as a journal than before in my former blog. But as usual with many differents subjects.</p>
<p>So now Let’s go in this new Web Adventure.</p>
