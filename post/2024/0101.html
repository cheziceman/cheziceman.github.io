<h3>2024-01-01 Let’s Go !</h3>
<p>Here the first post of this new blog. I used a french blog <a href="https://www.cheziceman.fr">there</a> but I wanted to begin something different with the challenge to do it in english. I wanted to go back to the roots of blogging, a real journal, a web log, without any periodicity. Just a post when I feel I have something interesting to say. And I wanted something simple, light and, of course, libre/free. The choice of english is maybe not natural for me, as french (yes, we are usually bad in english) but I work now more in english than before and I like this challenge. It’s also the better way to catch people from all over the world.</p>
<p>The idea is to do something not far from Gopher and now Gemini, those minimalistic protocols but with HTML…or Markdown converted to HTML as I did before with Jekkyl. But my goal was to find the easiest way to do a blog, with simple tools, not a single tool but the largest panel of tools you could choose. I will develop that kind of Dogma that I could call SimpleWeb. I would like something easy as a Text Editor and that’s all…Something you can read on very terminal, even with a bad 3G bandwidth. Something usable with a text-web-browser as Lynx, or every browser of the market in every condition (dark mode or not). The way to convert and to put the files online must also be simple but with many choices. I have my way to do it but I tried many ways also. The only link to update is on the index page. No need of a CMS or a static-site management. Default colors, default link colors and nothing else. I also asked myself about RSS but it’s not in the way I wanted to do. I’m a huge fan of RSS but here, you can read when you want, as you want. You are free and don’t need any subscription.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s no SEO, but I alway try to respect the standard of the web, those of the W3C of course, not Google and all the bullshits. But I don’t want to have meta names and tags everywhere. But it’s possible to do it, easily. I will explain later. So there’s not much written to be understood by a bot, but nothing to cancel a bot job. I won’t be easy to find in the search engines but that’s not my business. I do a blog for myself, for the love of writing, of sharing. I know that some people will find it too simple, not very fun with no pictures. I love pictures but here, I want to put the writing forward, the words and the time to read before the rest. Because I liked ASCII-art when I was young, I will put some of these arts sometimes, as you can see on the homepage. And you will easily understand that I’m trying to do something in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker">hacker</a> spirit, the initial meaning of the word, even if I’m bad at coding. As what I like in Haikus, I’m looking for something clean.</p>
<p>I don’t know what this blog will be but I’m sure it will be different of all I did before. I hope you will find it interesting, fun. And the posts and articles will be more as a journal than before in my former blog. But as usual with many differents subjects.</p>
<p>So now Let’s go in this new Web Adventure.</p>
